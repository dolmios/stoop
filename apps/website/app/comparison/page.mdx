# Stitches vs Stoop

Technical comparison between Stitches and Stoop CSS-in-JS libraries

## Overview

Stoop is a minimalist implementation of Stitches' high-level features. It provides a similar API for `styled`, `css`, and variants, but with some key differences.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Stitches | Stoop |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Type-safe CSS objects | Yes | Yes |
| Theme tokens with `$` prefix | Yes | Yes |
| Variant system | Yes | Yes |
| Polymorphic components (`as` prop) | Yes | Yes |
| CSS variables for themes | No | Yes |
| Runtime CSS injection | Yes | Yes |
| Build-time CSS extraction | Yes | No |
| Compound variants | Yes | No |
| Multi-theme support | Limited | Yes Built-in |
| Utility functions | Advanced | Basic |
| SSR support | Yes | Yes |
| React 16.8+ required | Yes | Yes |
| Next.js App Router | Yes | Yes |
| Next.js Pages Router | Yes | Yes |

## Key Differences

### Theme System

**Stitches:** Theme tokens resolve to runtime values injected via JavaScript.

**Stoop:** Theme tokens resolve to CSS variables (`var(--colors-primary)`), enabling instant theme switching without recompiling CSS.

### Multi-Theme Support

**Stitches:** Requires manual theme management.

**Stoop:** Built-in multi-theme support via `Provider` component with automatic CSS variable switching.

### Build-Time CSS Extraction

**Stitches:** Supports build-time CSS extraction for zero-runtime CSS.

**Stoop:** Runtime-only CSS generation. If you need build-time extraction, consider [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style) or [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com).

### Compound Variants

**Stitches:** Supports compound variants (combining multiple variant conditions).

**Stoop:** Does not support compound variants. Variants work independently.

### Utility Functions

**Stitches:** Advanced utility function system with extensive built-in utilities.

**Stoop:** Basic utility function support. You can create custom utilities, but fewer built-in utilities are provided.

## API Similarities

The core APIs are very similar:

```typescript
// Both libraries
const Button = styled("button", {
  padding: "$medium",
  backgroundColor: "$primary",
}, {
  variant: {
    primary: { backgroundColor: "$primary" },
    secondary: { backgroundColor: "$secondary" },
  },
});
```

## Migration Considerations

When migrating from Stitches to Stoop:

1. **Theme tokens:** Work the same way (`$medium`, `$primary`, etc.)
2. **Component API:** Mostly identical
3. **CSS variables:** Stoop uses CSS variables instead of runtime injection
4. **Multi-theme:** Requires `Provider` wrapper in Stoop
5. **Compound variants:** Need to be refactored to use separate variant props
6. **Utilities:** May need to recreate custom utilities

See the [Migration Guide](/migration) for detailed migration steps.

## When to Use Stoop

- You want a Stitches-like API with CSS variable-based theming
- You need built-in multi-theme support
- You prefer runtime CSS generation
- You don't need compound variants
- You want a simpler, more focused API

## When to Use Stitches

- You need compound variants
- You want build-time CSS extraction
- You need advanced utility functions
- You prefer the original Stitches implementation

## Development Status

**Stitches:** No longer actively maintained (as of 2024).

**Stoop:** Currently in active development (beta).
