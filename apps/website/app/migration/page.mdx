# Migration from Stitches

Migrate your Stitches codebase to Stoop

## Key Differences

Stoop is similar to Stitches but with some key differences:

- Stoop uses CSS variables for theme tokens (no runtime theme injection)
- Stoop supports 13 approved theme scales (same as Stitches)
- Stoop has built-in multi-theme support via Provider
- Stoop uses `$` prefix for theme tokens (same as Stitches)

## Migration Steps

1. **Install Stoop**

```bash
npm install stoop
```

2. **Update Imports**

```typescript
// Before (Stitches)
import { styled, css } from "@stitches/react";

// After (Stoop)
import { styled, css } from "./theme";
```

3. **Update Theme Configuration**

```typescript
// Before (Stitches)
const { styled, css } = createStitches({
  theme: { ... },
});

// After (Stoop)
const { styled, css } = createStoop({
  theme: { ... },
  themes: {
    light: lightTheme,
    dark: darkTheme,
  },
});
```

4. **Update Component Usage**

Component API is mostly the same:

```typescript
// Works the same in both
const Button = styled("button", {
  padding: "$medium",
  variants: {
    size: {
      small: { padding: "$small" },
    },
  },
});
```

## Breaking Changes

- Theme tokens resolve to CSS variables instead of runtime values
- Multi-theme requires Provider wrapper
- Some utility functions may differ
